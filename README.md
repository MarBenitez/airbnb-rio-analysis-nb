## Objective
 
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Airbnb dataset for Rio de Janeiro. This includes the following key tasks:
 
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
2. **Data Cleaning**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Variable Correlation Analysis**
 
Additionally, the project aims to develop an interactive application that will be useful for travelers to Rio de Janeiro in finding their ideal accommodation.
 

## Tasks Breakdown
 
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand the structure and content of the dataset
- Identify key variables and their distributions
- Detect patterns and anomalies
- Visualize the data for better insights
 
### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values
- Correct inconsistencies in the data
- Handle outliers and anomalies
- Remove duplicates and irrelevant data
 
### 3. Feature Engineering
- Create new features to enhance the dataset
- Transform existing variables for better analysis
- Encode categorical variables
- Generate interaction terms if necessary
 
### 4. Variable Correlation Analysis
- Compute correlation coefficients
- Visualize correlations using heatmaps or scatter plots
- Identify highly correlated variables
- Understand relationships between different features

## Notebooks
To run the analysis:

- In you local: simply download and open [airbnb_rio.ipynb](https://github.com/MarBenitez/airbnb-rio-analysis-nb/blob/main/airbnb_rio.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and follow the code cells. The notebook is thoroughly documented to guide you through the analysis process.

- Google Drive: follow the link to the [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t860c_fNDIO7j4IWnhpWcynj6zNL05lb?usp=sharing) and open the airbnb_rio_colab.ipynb in Colab.

 
## Interactive Application Development
 
- Design and implement an [interactive application](https://github.com/juuliquintana/airbnb-rio-streamlit-app)
- Ensure user-friendly interface and navigation
- Integrate the EDA insights to help travelers
- Provide filters and search functionality for accommodations
- Display key metrics and visualizations to aid decision-making
 
## Tools and Technologies
 
- **Python** for data analysis and cleaning
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for feature engineering
- **Streamlit** or **Dash** for building the interactive application
 
## Conclusion
 
By completing this project, we aim to provide valuable insights into the Airbnb market in Rio de Janeiro. The interactive application will serve as a practical tool for travelers to find their ideal accommodation based on data-driven analysis.
